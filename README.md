🧠 Agentic AI Workflows for Clinical Intelligence

Welcome to our repository, where we showcase modular, agentic AI workflows engineered to empower real-time clinical decision support. These systems are designed to function as proactive clinical co-pilots, adept at analyzing patient data, synthesizing evidence, and autonomously escalating risks using FHIR, LangChain, and LLM-powered orchestration.
Key Features:

    Encryption: Secure handling of sensitive data with AES-256-GCM encryption.
    Fallback Logic: Robust mechanisms to ensure reliability and continuity.
    Self-Healing Agents: Autonomous recovery and maintenance capabilities.
    Explainability Layers: Transparent decision-making processes for enhanced trust and accountability.

These workflows are ideal for integration into EHR systems, hospital operations, and health AI startups, providing a seamless blend of advanced AI and clinical expertise.

    ⚠️ Important Note: For security and commercial reasons, the workflow JSON files are not included in this repository. If you are interested in a demonstration or licensing options, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or email me at jacobjoshy@pm.me.

🔧 Featured Agents
🧬 1. Clinical Decision Support Agent

    Data Ingestion: Processes multi-omics data, laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical notes.
    Orchestration: Utilizes LangGraph-style sub-agents for tasks such as ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction) detection, dosing recommendations, and risk assessment.
    Security: Encrypts PHI (Protected Health Information) using AES-256-GCM via Vault.
    Output: Delivers structured, explainable insights compatible with FHIR standards.

⏱ 2. Continuous Patient Monitoring Agent

    Integration: Connects with wearables, laboratory systems, and remote symptom trackers.
    Anomaly Detection: Employs GPT-based algorithms to detect anomalies and escalate concerns to clinicians.
    Real-Time Updates: Maintains a memory graph that updates in real-time, ensuring up-to-date patient monitoring.

📚 3. Medical Research & Evidence Synthesis Agent

    Data Retrieval: Automatically queries databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane.
    Analysis: Utilizes LLMs for screening, synthesizing, and conducting meta-analyses.
    Knowledge Graph: Autonomously updates a clinical knowledge graph to provide the latest evidence-based insights.

💊 4. Drug Interaction Agent (vFINAL)

This production-grade agent, built with n8n, offers a comprehensive solution for managing drug interactions:

    Secure Data Ingestion: Accepts FHIR data via a secure webhook with API key authentication.
    Data Processing: Performs deduplication, validation, and AES-256 encryption of PHI.
    LLM Integration: Invokes LLM-based ADR prediction, risk stratification, and dosage guidance.
    Circuit Breaker: Implements a circuit breaker to prevent excessive LLM usage and potential runaway processes.
    Alert Routing: Sends alerts to Slack, EHR APIs, and DLQ with comprehensive audit logging.
    Metrics Export: Exports critical metrics such as latency, confidence scores, and fallback rates to the Prometheus Pushgateway.
    Resilience: Includes self-healing tests, daily cron health checks, and CI runners to ensure continuous reliability.

🔐 Design Philosophy

    Agentic Execution: Each workflow is designed to operate with a degree of autonomy, utilizing memory and control flow to simulate domain-specific decision-making.
    Data Privacy: All workflows are PHI-aware and employ AES-256 encryption, DLQ, and Vault-based secret management to ensure data security.
    Built-In Resilience: Features such as retry logic, circuit breakers, self-healing tests, and DLQ routing are integrated to enhance reliability.
    Observability: Metrics including latency, fallback rates, and confidence scores are exported to Prometheus dashboards for real-time monitoring.
