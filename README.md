## Agentic AI Workflows for Clinical Intelligence

This repository showcases a set of modular, agentic AI workflows designed to support real-time decision-making in healthcare. These systems combine structured memory, multi-modal patient data, and large language model reasoning to create proactive, intelligent clinical copilots.

>  **Note**: Full n8n workflow JSONs are excluded due to commercial sensitivity. This repo shares architectural designs, agent capabilities, and integration strategies only. For demo access, please contact [Jacob Thomas Joshy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-thomas-joshy/).
